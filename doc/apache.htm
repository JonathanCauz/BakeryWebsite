<h3 id=CF>Configuration Files</h3>

<p>The Apache2 configuration files are under /etc/apache2.</p>

<p>In addition to the files listed below, the following directories are also used:</p>
<ul>
<li>conf-enabled: holds symlinks to the files in /etc/apache2/conf-available. When a configuration file is symlinked, it will be enabled the next time apache2 is restarted.</li>
<li>mods-enabled: holds symlinks to the files in /etc/apache2/mods-available. When a module configuration file is symlinked it will be enabled the next time apache2 is restarted.</li>
<li>sites-enabled: like mods-enabled, sites-enabled contains symlinks to the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory. Similarly when a configuration file in sites-available is symlinked, the site configured by it will be active once Apache2 is restarted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in addition, other configuration files may be added using the Include directive, and wildcards can be used to include many configuration files. Any directive may be placed in any of these configuration files. Changes to the main configuration files are only recognized by Apache2 when it is started or restarted.</p>


<h3>.conf Files</h3>

<table cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><th>Files</th><th>Description</th></tr>

</td></tr>

<tr><td>sites-available/000-default.conf</td><td>
The sites-available directory has configuration files for Apache2 Virtual Hosts. Virtual Hosts allow Apache2 to be configured for multiple sites that have separate configurations. This is the configuration file for http (port 80) connections.

<h2>.load Files</h3>

<p>The /etc/apache2/mods-available directory contains load files. Each .load file specifies
<ul>
<li>The module name</li>
<li>The shared object path</li>
<li>(optional) Modules on which the module depends</li>
</ul>
<p>Some modules also have associated .conf files, used to configure the module when it is loaded.</p>

<h3><a href='https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/'>Modules</a></h3>


<h3 id=CL>Configuration File Language</h3>

<p>
The configutation files consist of directives that control Apache processing.
</p>
<p>
Each directive is normally specified on one line. The backslash "\" may be used as the last 
character on a line to indicate that the directive continues onto the next line. 
</p>
<p>
Arguments to directives are separated by whitespace. If an argument contains spaces, you must enclose that argument in quotes.
</p>
<p>
Directives in the configuration files are case-insensitive, but arguments to directives are often case sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Lines that begin with the hash character "#" are considered comments, and are ignored. Comments may not be included on the same line as a configuration directive. White space occurring before a directive is ignored, so you may indent directives for clarity. Blank lines are also ignored.
</p>
<p>
The values of variables defined with the Define of or shell environment variables can be used in configuration file lines using the syntax ${VAR}. If "VAR" is the name of a valid variable, the value of that variable is substituted into that spot in the configuration file line, and processing continues as if that text were found directly in the configuration file. Variables defined with Define take precedence over shell environment variables. If the "VAR" variable is not found, the characters ${VAR} are left unchanged, and a warning is logged. Variable names may not contain colon ":" characters, to avoid clashes with RewriteMap's syntax.
</p>
<p>
Only shell environment variables defined before the server is started can be used in expansions. Environment variables defined in the configuration file itself, for example with SetEnv, take effect too late to be used for expansions in the configuration file.
</p>
<p>
The maximum length of a line in normal configuration files, after variable substitution and joining any continued lines, is approximately 16 MiB. In .htaccess files, the maximum length is 8190 characters.
</p>
<p>
You can check your configuration files for syntax errors without starting the server by using apachectl configtest or the -t command line option.
</p>
<p>
You can use mod_info's -DDUMP_CONFIG to dump the configuration with all included files and environment variables resolved and all comments and non-matching <IfDefine> and <IfModule> sections removed. However, the output does not reflect the merging or overriding that may happen for repeated directives.
</p>

<h3>Sections</h3>

<p>
Configuration sections are used to restrict the scope of the containing directives to a file, directory, host, URL and so on.
</p>
<p>
Configuration sections are also used to conditional activate the containing directives if some
condition is true. For example, the directives enclosed in an If directive section are only 
applied if the condition of the if directive evaluates to true.
